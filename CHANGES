Changes since 0.32.1

 - Fix unit tests broken in previous build

 - Added patch to avoid leaking memory when throwing dbus
   errors from the XS layer

 - Added support for org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties
   in exported & remote objects.

 - Added support for getting the unique name of the client's
   connection to the bus

 - Added support for getting the unique name of the client
   owning a service on the bus

 - RemoteService object constructor gains an extra parameter
   for the owner of the service at the time it was aquired to
   deal with issues where a service is replaced.

 - Cache RemoteService objects to avoid creating multiple
   instances for the same service name.

 - Fix caching of objects by the service to avoid caching
   objects cast to a specific interface

 - Make add_signal_receiver method on Net::DBus private

 - Use introspection data for hinting only, not absolute truth
   since Python bindings don't provide complete data.

 - Adding correct handling for (de)marshalling variant data
   type to fix interaction with python bindings

 - Added magic 'caller' and 'serial' data types for requesting
   that data about method caller be passed into a method

 - Lots more POD documentation

 - Added 'lshal.pl' demo script for listing HAL devices

 - Made example scripts interoperate correctly with example
   scripts from Python & GLib bindings

Changes since 0.32.0

 - The order of 'service_name' and 'bus' parameter to the
   Net::DBus::Service constructor is reversed to match
   that of Net::DBus::RemoteService

 - The order of 'service' and 'object_path' parameter to the
   Net::DBus::Object constructor is reversed to match
   that of Net::DBus::RemoteObject

 - No longer neccessary to construct an explicit Net::DBus::Service
   object - one is constructed & returned by the 'export_service'
   method on Net::DBus

 - The 'find' method on Net::DBus will search for & attach to
   a suitable bus, so no longer neccessary to hard code either
   system or session bus

 - Introspection data is no longer provided via the
   Net::DBus::Object constructor. Consult the manual pages
   for Net::DBus::OBject and Net::DBus::Exporter for details
   of new approach to defining introspection data.

 - The Net::DBus::Introspector class is no longer for public
   use.

 - The Net::DBus::Dumper class can be used to display a dump
   of an object's exported API cf examples/dump-object.pl

 - Signal handler callbacks now get the actual signal params
   passed in, rather than low level bind info

 - The Net::DBus objects are automatically registered with
   the default reactor mainloop, unless 'nomainloop => 1'
   is passed into constructor
